# Scar-Wars
This is a project that allows multiple users to collaborate on creating a collection of playlists made up of songs that fit a certain pattern.
It was inspired by my friend who made many of these albums.  Each one had:
16 songs,
started with a song that was the opening to something,
ended with a song in a foriegn language,
had at least one song from every decade since the 60s,
was between 50 and 60 minutes total,
had a disney song, and an intrumental song,
and most importantly, never repeated any artists across all the playlists.
This deployment-ready project will keep track of all these rules itself, and tell a user if they have made an invalid playlist.
